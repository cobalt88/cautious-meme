 ## Overall Description 

 A very basic e-store that will eventually be made into a reusable open source template that is easily maintainable and scalable. One other core feature to the overall architecture of this project is to dynamically display content on any size screen. Everything from the smallest smart phone to the largest ultra-wide displays. 

 ## Installation Instructions

Once the application reaches a minimum viable product deployment stage there will be instructions here for setting up a local instance of this application for development purposes. Otherwise fo client side use there is no installation required as it will be a fully deployed web application. 

 ## Instructions/How To Use

instructions coming soon.

 ## Contribution Guidelines
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the date of the commit}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{who is making the commit}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator, 

 5. once this application leaves the beta release environment these rules and guidelines may be subject to change.
